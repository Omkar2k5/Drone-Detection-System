# Drone Detection System

The Drone Detection System is an advanced solution designed to detect and mitigate unauthorized drone activity in sensitive areas. Drones, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), pose security risks in various sectors, including military installations, critical infrastructure, and public events. This system employs a combination of sensor technologies, machine learning algorithms, and real-time data analysis to identify and respond to drone incursions swiftly and effectively.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Sensor Fusion:** Integrates data from multiple sensors, including radar, radio frequency (RF) scanners, and video cameras, to provide comprehensive coverage and accurate detection of drones.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Utilizes machine learning techniques, such as computer vision and pattern recognition, to distinguish drones from other objects and mitigate false positives.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Monitors airspace in real-time, providing instant alerts to security personnel upon detecting unauthorized drone activity.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed with scalability in mind, allowing the system to adapt to varying deployment scenarios, from small-scale installations to large-scale deployments across multiple sites.
- **Customizable Alerts:** Offers customizable alerting mechanisms, including email notifications, SMS alerts, and integration with existing security systems, to ensure timely responses to drone threats.
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Stores historical data on drone activity for post-incident analysis and forensic investigations, enabling organizations to understand patterns and trends in drone incursions over time.

## Installation

To install and run the Drone Detection System, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drone-detection-system.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd drone-detection-system
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Configure the system by editing the `config.ini` file and specifying the appropriate settings for your deployment environment.

5. Run the system:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the Drone Detection System is up and running, it will continuously monitor the airspace for drone activity. Security personnel will receive real-time alerts via the configured alerting mechanisms whenever unauthorized drone activity is detected. The system's web interface provides an intuitive dashboard for monitoring and analyzing drone incursions, viewing historical data, and configuring system settings.
